In this project I created a wireframe that gets a certain rectangular input and returns a 3D map according to the values in the rectangle

ARROW KEYS:
left -> to move image left,
right -> to move image right,
up -> to move image up,
down -> to move image down,

+ sign -> shifts the upper levels in the input up,
- sign -> shifts the upper levels in the input down,

0 -> zooms in the image,
1 -> zooms out of the image,
