In this project I created a wireframe that gets a certain rectangular input and returns a 3D map according to the values in the rectangle

ARROW KEYS:

left -> to move image left,

right -> to move image right,

up -> to move image up,

down -> to move image down,


plus sign in number pad -> shifts the upper levels in the input up,

minus sign in number pad -> shifts the upper levels in the input down,


0 in number pad -> zooms in the image,

1 in number pad -> zooms out of the image,
